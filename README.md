# Keycodes
The key codes vary quite a bit between browsers and platforms. This is a nonexhaustive list of all the different keycodes. Use the `lookup_key` function to get the key name for a key code. Agents include:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* IE
* Opera

The "default" keycodes are those that are common to all agents and the native platform.
