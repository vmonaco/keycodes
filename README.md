# Keycodes
The key codes vary quite a bit between browsers and platforms. This is a nonexhaustive list of all the different keycodes. Use the `lookup_key` function to get the key name for a particular key code. Browsers included are:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* IE
* Opera
* Safari

The common keycodes are those that are common to all the platforms (including the host OS). Some keycodes defined on the native host OS do not appear in any of the browsers. See the [table](master/keycode.csv).
